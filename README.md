Integrated Disaster prediction and Donation assistance system
The Problem 
With today’s world seeing an alarming increase in the number of natural disasters across the globe, its impact on human lives is beyond comprehension and is an issue of grave concern. These events create chaos and disrupt lives of millions of people making everyday a struggle.
Purpose of the Project
This vision is an honest attempt at reducing the curse of catastrophic natural disasters on human lives, by being better prepared using a smart awareness system with prediction techniques and also to make the aftermath more bearable. Despite of a lot of people willing to extend a helping hand to the victims of natural disasters, lack of awareness about how and where to do so, leads to less contribution than is intended. We here, are setting up a platform to avoid chaos in the donation system, such that volunteers can find the correct and easy means to donate, thereby bridging the gap between the donors and the recipients. 
Proposed Solution
•	Smart Prediction system for potential disasters based on weather monitoring and meteorology studies. 
•	Based on the analysis above, come up with better solutions for relief management along with prevention and evacuation techniques.
•	Detailed documentation and analysis of natural disasters with respect to geographic location, frequency of occurrence, number of people affected and intensity of the event. 
•	Real time alert system to keep the users of our app informed (using news flash) and up to date about any natural disaster around the world, thereby encouraging more donations.
•	Provide options for the donors to make monetary donations using secure payment gateway. Also, include nearby drop-off locations and drive through options, for other forms of donation (food, clothing, healthcare etc).
•	Optimized distribution of necessities for the affected people at the earliest, ensuring maximum reach to the victims. 
•	Systematic organization to take care of edibles and food donations, special focus on expiry date and making sure it reaches the people affected by the disaster on time.
Our platform not only aids to emergency donation crisis, but also keeps options open for donations for non-emergency causes, such as old age homes, orphanages and NGOs.
